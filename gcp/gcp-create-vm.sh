# This performs the commands in "Creating a Virtual Machine" (GSP001) at
#    https://google-run.qwiklab.com/focuses/4?parent=catalog
# which is part of quest ...

# Instead of typing, copy this command to run in the console within the cloud:
# sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wilsonmar/DevSecOps/master/qwiklabs/gcp-create-vm.sh)"
# by Wilson Mar, Wisdom Hambolu, and others.

# This adds steps to grep values into variables for verification,
# so you can spend time learning rather than typing and fixing typos.
# This script deletes folders left over from previous run so can be rerun.
# SCRIPT STATUS: WORKING. Results obtained after running twice on May 25, 2018.
