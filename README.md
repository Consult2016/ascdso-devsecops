Learn to create an automated workflow that automatically brings up Docker containers in the cloud with monitoring and auto-scaling.

We use a revolutionary approach that enable you to legitimately claim this on your resume:

<strong>"Automated with bash scripts an end-to-end CI/CD Jenkins Groovy workflow, triggered by changes in GitHub, to test and deploy with SSL certificates Dockerized apps using Kubernetes to auto-scale within Google cloud."</strong>

Here's what:

* Follow our manual procedures step-by-step to setup cloud accounts.
* Configure and run automated scripts to set it all up.
* Make a change in GitHub and servers are automatically reset.
* See additional servers get instantiated under load.
* See servers de-provisioned when load subsides.
* Make changes to the scripts to learn scripting and debugging.

## Automation Components

With this course, you skip the fumbling around because we have already figured it out for you.

This course provides everything you need to get it done:

1. Instructions on doing the manual aspects (setup accounts, obtain certificate for HTTPS)
2. A private repository on GitHub with Web Hooks to recognize changes
3. Bash scripts to setup the utility environment above (Jenkins, database, Graphana)
4. Groovy scripts in a Jenkins server on Cloudbees to update servers
5. Ansible script https://www.ansible.com/use-cases-overview
6. A Digital Ocean account of the appropriate size
7. Node sample project with linting and functional testing automation
8. NGINX web server for front-end load balancing
9. A static website with a Dockerfile
10. cAdvisor to forward server metrics to InfluxDB
11. InfluxDB database instance to hold and summarize monitoring statistics
12. Graphana instance to display monitoring trends
13. JMeter scripts to generate load which invoke auto-scaling

Our approach is to have you see us run the scripts in a video,
then you do it yourself by following our step-by-step instructions.

If you get stuck, we provide one-on-one mentoring sessions.

We then let you loose to experiment with changing configurations and experiencing the consequences.
For example, change the size of servers used.

The scripts are designed to be idempotent.
So run them again and you're good as new.

Additional extensions of this course include switching out components with alternatives,
such as use of NGINX Pro for monitoring instead.
