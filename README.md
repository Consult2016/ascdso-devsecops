This repo contains assets for a hands-on DevSecOps class which enables you to legitimately claim this on your resume:

<strong>"Automated with bash scripts an end-to-end CI/CD Jenkins Groovy workflow, triggered by changes in GitHub, to instantiate using Docker, build, test, and deploy to several environments a 12 Facter app, using Kubernetes to load-balance and auto-scale within a monitored Google cloud that has logging."</strong>

This is not a bunch of talk and fancy PowerPoint.

Our approach is that you follow our step-by-step instructions so you can see the scripts run, first-hand.

Along the way, PROTIP comments highlight tips and tricks of the pros, such as:

1. How to write bash scripts to be "idempotent", so you can run them again and again.
2. How to check for errors at each step so the script stops upon error.
3. How to avoid using the wrong geographic zone (a mistake can can cost a lot of money).
4. How to setup your laptop quickly (using dotfiles and brew/chocolatey).

Here is what you'll do:
BTW, If you get stuck, we provide one-on-one coaching and mentoring sessions while we share screens.

1. Sign up for a Google cloud account.
1. Sign up for accounts on GitHub, Docker.
1. Clone sample repositories on your own laptop.

0. Generate based on Swagger OpenAPI specs file.
0. Setup auto-detection of file changes to invoke local code scan.

0. Add web hooks to your source code repository to recognize and act on changes.
0. Define maven pom.xml file.
0. Setup Jenkins server to fire off.
0. Groovy scripts in a Jenkins server on Cloudbees cloud.
0. Edit a NodeJs sample project with linting and functional testing automation
0. Dockerize the app by defining a Dockerfile for the app.
0. Setup SonarQube server and rules to scan source code.
8. Define front-end load balancing in Kubernetes.

0. Construct Selenium using JUnit to test Java coding.
0. Construct Pact proxy to conduct automated integration testing.
0. Define JMeter scripts to generate load which invoke auto-scaling

0. cAdvisor to forward server metrics to InfluxDB
0. InfluxDB database instance to hold and summarize monitoring statistics
0. Graphana instance to display monitoring trends

With this course, you skip the fumbling around because we have already figured it out for you.
