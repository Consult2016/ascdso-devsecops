<i>{{ page.excerpt }}</i>

This repo was moved to https://github.com/wilsonmar/mac-setup

This article explains the script that builds a Mac machine with "everything" needed by a professional developer.

Technical techniques for the Bash shell scripting techniques used here are described separtely at [Bash scripting page in this website](/bash-coding/).

Other websites are quoted where techniques are discussed.

The script is controlled by customization of file <strong>secrets.sh</strong>.

## Mac apps

I prefer using brew cask to install GUI apps.

There is a program ("mas") that manages Apple Store apps, but it only manages apps that have already been paid for.
It does not install apps new to your Apple Store account.

## Logging

The script outputs logs to a file.

This is so that during runs, what appears on the command console are only what is relevant to debugging the current issue.

At the end of the script, the log is shown in an editor to <strong>enable search</strong> through the whole log.

## Update all

We wrote this script to help manage the complexity of competing stacks of components and their different versions.

## Automatic upgrade

On repeated executions, this script installs the latest versions of all components when "update" is added to the 

But with some, such as Java, 

## Uninstall

This script does not automatically uninstall modules.
It's just too dangerous.

## Backups

Backups of each file updated are made before changes.



## Eclips IDE plug-ins

http://download.eclipse.org/releases/juno

Within Eclipse IDE, get a list of plugins at Help -> Install New Software -> Select a repo -> select a plugin -> go to More -> General Information -> Identifier

   <pre>eclipse -application org.eclipse.equinox.p2.director \
-destination d:/eclipse/ \
-profile SDKProfile  \
-clean -purgeHistory  \
-noSplash \
-repository http://download.eclipse.org/releases/juno/ \
-installIU org.eclipse.cdt.feature.group, \
   org.eclipse.egit.feature.group
   </pre>

   "Equinox" is the runtime environment of Eclipse, which is the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.vogella.de/articles/OSGi/article.html">reference implementation of OSGI</a>.
   Thus, Eclipse plugins are architectually the same as bundles in OSGI.

   Notice that there are different versions of Eclipse repositories, such as "juno".

   PROTIP: Although one can install several at once, do it one at a time to see if you can actually use each one.
   Some of them:

   <pre>
   org.eclipse.cdt.feature.group, \
   org.eclipse.egit.feature.group, \
   org.eclipse.cdt.sdk.feature.group, \
   org.eclipse.linuxtools.cdt.libhover.feature.group, \
   org.eclipse.wst.xml_ui.feature.feature.group, \
   org.eclipse.wst.web_ui.feature.feature.group, \
   org.eclipse.wst.jsdt.feature.feature.group, \
   org.eclipse.php.sdk.feature.group, \
   org.eclipse.rap.tooling.feature.group, \
   org.eclipse.linuxtools.cdt.libhover.devhelp.feature.feature.group, \
   org.eclipse.linuxtools.valgrind.feature.group, \
   </pre>

   A feature group is a list of plugins and other features which can be understood as a logical separate project unit
   for the updates manager and for the build process.
